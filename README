This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to obtain the results presents in “Barrington et al. (2022) Wind speed as a dominant source of periodicities in reported emission rates of volcanic SO2”.

The results in this paper were produced using the MASTER SCRIPT ("MasterScript.m") uploaded here which has been provided in the interest of research integrity. This MasterScript calls on the functions contained in “MasterScript_functions.zip”. The full method is outlined in Section 2(and Appendix B) of Barrington et al.(2022). This version of the code is not thoroughly commented nor is it free of redundancies. Figures produced using this code have been modified and formatted independently but the data remains unchanged. Users wishing to apply similar analysis to their own datasets, are instead directed to use the user-friendly snippets of code that are provided. 

Sections of this code have been re-written ("UserFriendly.m") in order to provide a user-friendly option for those wishing to apply similar analysis to their own datasets. Although it is not intended as a stand-alone code it includes MATLAB code for applying the bootstrap approach, plotting the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and comparing the PSD estimates between two variables. This script differ slightly from the code used in "MasterScript.m". Hardcoding and redundant lines have been removed, the analysis procedure is the same however. 

Code is written in MATLAB using version R2021a (MathsWorks, 2019) and utilises several in-built functions including the ‘plomb’ function to produce Lomb-Scargle Periodograms. This function requires the Signal Processing Toolbox; Spectral Analysis Toolbox. For further details see: https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/plomb.html.
