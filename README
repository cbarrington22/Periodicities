This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to obtain the results presents in “Barrington et al. (2022) Wind speed as a dominant source of periodicities in reported emission rates of volcanic SO2”.

The results in this paper were produced using the MASTER SCRIPT ("MasterScript.m") uploaded here which has been provided in the interest of research integrity. This MasterScript calls on the functions contained in “MasterScript_functions.zip”. This version of the code is not thoroughly commented nor is it free of redundancies and figures produced using this code have been modified and formatted independently although the data remains unchanged. 

Users wishing to apply similar analysis to their own datasets, are instead directed to the USER-FRIENDLY SCRIPT ("UserFriendly.m") which provides the necessary code to apply the method to other time series data. This script includes MATLAB code for applying the bootstrap approach, calculating the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and comparing the PSD estimates between two variables. Although it is not necessarily intended as a stand-alone code, running the whole script enables the user to produce the equivalent of Fig. 6a after defining a timeseries variable. The code in this script differs slightly from that of the MASTER SCRIPT. Hardcoding and redundant lines have been removed (as far as possible), the analysis procedure is the same however. 

Code is written in MATLAB using version R2021a (MathsWorks, 2019) and utilises several in-built functions including the ‘plomb’ function to produce Lomb-Scargle Periodograms. This function requires the Signal Processing Toolbox. For further details see: https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/plomb.html.
